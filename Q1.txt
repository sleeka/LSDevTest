--> List of groups ‘User A’ has a member in:
(I'm using "Richard Hendriks" as 'User A')

SELECT name FROM groups WHERE id in (
(SELECT group_id FROM memberships INNER JOIN users ON memberships.user_id=users.id WHERE users.fname='Richard' AND users.lname='Hendriks')


# alternate answer (more explicit, perhaps slower)
SELECT name FROM groups WHERE id in (
	SELECT group_id FROM memberships WHERE user_id = (
		SELECT id FROM users WHERE fname='Richard' and lname='Hendriks'
		)
	)

SELECT fname FROM users WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM memberships INNER JOIN groups ON groups.id=memberships.id WHERE groups.name='GroupA' or groups.name='GroupB')


# alternate answer (more explicit, perhaps slower)
